# PONG-Wars
classical arcade pong with a twist

## Brief History
The game was written by me in visual studio 2010 originally and today I thought let's share it with everyone. It was my first step 
into game programming in both concept and practice while taking first steps intp computer programming.

This game has quite a lot of bugs, implementation problems and what not. BUT, Hey, IT WORKS!

If you would like to add to it, clone it, correct it, optimise it. You are more than welcome to do so.

I have written brief comments for the game-code, so that reading it becomes easier.

## How to Play

After you have downloaded the repo and set it up;
- open the Solution file (.sln) in visual studio (I tested it in VS2010 and VS2017)
- click run. (I hope that it works for you, if not check wether you have correctly unzipped the files in a single folder. and the error
if any, may provide a hint, try googling it)
- a small window should pop-up with a text box entry on the bottom.
- Enter the number of points you want to play for (max is 99!)
- then click on play
- The game window pops-up, with a countdown timer of 5 seconds
- For the left player the movement controls are 'W' 'S' and for the right player 'UP' 'DOWN' arrow keys
- for the rest of the instructions click on help in previous menu

! - press 'P' to pause during play and dont let the ball miss you


## Known issues
+ In VS2017 the ball flickers a lot during movement ruining the game play, I might work on it sometime!
+ The paddles can fall through the bounds and you might lose them. So keep your paddles safe!
+ The arrow attack feature has a simultaneous both player clash problem, and causes jitters, Uhhh!

+ Hmm! for now I can think of just these two, but I believe there are about a thousand
